Solver for Wordle based on the 3Blue1Brown video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v68zYyaEmEA&amp;ab_channel=3Blue1Brown

Can be run by downloading the repo and running solve.py from inside it. When solve.py prompts you to enter the pattern for its calculated guess, enter in the following format: with "b" for black, "y" for yellow, and "g" for green. For example, if your pattern after entering a guess was green green yellow black yellow you would enter ggyby when prompted.
