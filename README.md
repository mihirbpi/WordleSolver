# WordleSolver
Solver for Wordle based on the first version of the program in the 3Blue1Brown video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v68zYyaEmEA

Can be run by downloading the repo and running solve.py from inside it on your command line. When solve.py prompts you to enter the pattern for its calculated guess, enter in the following format: "b" for black, "y" for yellow, and "g" for green. For example, if your pattern after entering solve.py's guess into Wordle was green green yellow black yellow you would enter ggyby into the command line when prompted.
